1.	“Usertype” pie chart – “customers” = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user.  “Subscribers” = annual member
User Type pie chart reveals that there are significantly more “subscribers” than “customers”, 1,900,359 vs 443,865.  It is a “healthy” proportion since subscribers usually mean more stable revenue.  With close to two million of subscribers, NYC Citi bike program is in demand for those who seek affordable and convenient way to get around.  User type category easily demonstrates short and long-time usage behavior/loyalty to the program.  This can give some meaningful insights into what one could or should not expect in Des Moines

2.	“August Peak Hours” bar chart - 
August 2019 data suggests that there is more traffic during the summer months.  The peak hours for bike trips during the month of August are between 7am-8am and 5pm – 6pm.  This will help estimate how many bikes might be needed in Des Moines.

3.	“Checkout time for Users” line chart -
The peak time bikes are checked out for all riders is about 5-6 minutes at 140K bikes.  After that time, the number of bikes checked out drops drastically

5.	“Trips by weekdays for each hour” heat map -
Mondays and Tuesdays from 5pm to 6pm show the most bike trips.  Thursdays and Fridays from 5pm to 6pm exhibit a similar pattern.  Mornings, in general, appear to be somewhat bike trip “balanced” across all five work days

6.	“Trips by Gender (weekday per hour) heat map
Overall males exhibit more trip activity.  There is a visible trip consistency per weekday per hour.  Monday to Friday 8am and 5pm to 6pm are the busiest times for the male bikers.  Females mimic that schedule; however, with less “intensity.”

# Summary:
 ## Conclusions 
 ## Dashboard summary [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aggie.jasinski/viz/NYCCitiBikeSharingProgramDashboardSummary/NYCfinaldashboard?publish=yes) 
 
-	Subscribers add stability to NYC Citi Bike program.  Revenue growth is more predictable with subscribers.
-	Morning hours between 7am to 8am and evening 5pm to 6pm can be defined as “rush hour with high demand.”
-	Based on August data, it can be concluded that the summer months exhibit the most bike traffic
-	Males tend to dominate the NYC Citi Bike program.
## Suggestions
-	Invest in customer tracking studies primarily focusing on the group’s needs and desires when it comes to biking
-	Introduce strong customer incentives that would help turn users into subscribers
-	Understand customers’ resistance to subscriptions
-	Monitor subscribers’ needs and desires so they become longtime program loyalists
- Future analysis of gender driven subscriptions is suggested. "What are the gender driven program expectations that  make one group outnumber the other as subscribers?"

- Exploring gender vs peak hours: "Why does the bike-sharing program see the peak hours soar with males leaving female group behind?" Gender could play a key role in overall bike-sharing program success.
